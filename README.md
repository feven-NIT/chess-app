To configure a deployment based on the `ubi9/httpd-24` server to accept and handle POST requests, you would typically need to create a custom script or application to process the incoming POST data. Here's a basic example using a PHP script to handle the incoming POST requests and print the received data. 

1. Create a PHP script named `post_handler.php`:

```php
<?php
$post_data = file_get_contents("php://input");
echo "Received POST data: " . $post_data;
?>
```

2. Save the PHP script `post_handler.php` in a directory. Let's name this directory `post-handler`.

3. Create a ConfigMap to store the PHP script:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: post-handler-config
data:
  post_handler.php: |
    <?php
    $post_data = file_get_contents("php://input");
    echo "Received POST data: " . $post_data;
    ?>
```

4. Create a Deployment configuration that mounts the PHP script from the ConfigMap into the Apache server's document root:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: ubi8/httpd-24
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        volumeMounts:
        - name: script-volume
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: script-volume
        configMap:
          name: post-handler-config
```

5. Create a Service to expose the deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpd-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: httpd
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
```

6. Apply these configurations using `oc apply -f <filename>`.

Now, when you send a POST request to your server, it will execute the PHP script `post_handler.php` and print the received data. Ensure that your server is reachable and you have proper network configurations to reach the server from where you are sending the POST request.
